# MyCustomSortProject

MyCustomSortProject is a C# solution aimed at demonstrating custom sorting algorithms and their practical applications. The project explores efficient ways to sort data, including examples of custom comparison logic and various use cases for sorting in real-world scenarios.

## Features

- **Custom Sorting Algorithms:** Implementations of user-defined sorting logic.
- **Extensibility:** Designed to add and test new sorting methods easily.
- **Sorting Comparators:** Supports custom comparison logic for complex data structures.
- **Performance Testing:** Includes functionality to measure the performance of sorting algorithms.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) version 6.0 or higher.
- Any modern IDE that supports C# (e.g., [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) or [JetBrains Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/)).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/puncker1978/MyCustomSortProject.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd MyCustomSortProject
   ```
3. Open the solution file `MyCustomSortProject.sln` in your preferred IDE.

### Running the Application

1. Build the project in your IDE.
2. Run the application.
3. Follow on-screen instructions to input data and select sorting options.

## Usage

This project allows users to:

1. Experiment with predefined sorting algorithms.
2. Test custom comparison functions for sorting objects (e.g., sorting by specific fields).
3. Analyze performance metrics of different sorting methods.
